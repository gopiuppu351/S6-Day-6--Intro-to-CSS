      Siddaramaiah is a seasoned Indian politician and the current Chief
      Minister of Karnataka, serving his second term. Born on August 12, 1948,
      in Mysore district, he hails from a humble farming family and belongs to
      the Kuruba community. A lawyer by profession, Siddaramaiah began his
      political career in the 1980s with the Bharatiya Lok Dal before joining
      the Janata Dal. He later became a key leader in the Indian National
      Congress. Known for his pro-poor and socially inclusive policies, his
      tenure is marked by initiatives like the Anna Bhagya scheme, providing
      free rice to the underprivileged. He has also focused on healthcare,
      education, and social justice. Siddaramaiah's straightforward personality
      and grassroots connection have earned him significant popularity in
      Karnataka politics.
